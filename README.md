# Palmer Penguins Nearest Neighbor Classifier
In this program, we explore the Palmer Penguins dataset and build a nearest neighbor classifier.   
We will use the functionality of Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/), Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/), and Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/). As well as Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for some data visualization.
